# FNA Adjuster: Align with Math, Refine with Feel

> **Stop struggling with coordinate systems. Start placing objects with professional ease.**

**FNA Adjuster** is a high-precision transform utility designed to eliminate the friction of object placement in Blender. Whether you are a hard-surface modeler needing perfect alignment or a set-dresser looking for a more tactile way to layout scenes, this tool bridges the gap between mathematical accuracy and artistic intuition.

## What does "FNA" stand for?

**FNA** stands for **Face Normal Align**.
It represents the core DNA of this tool: extracting perfect rotation data directly from your geometry's faces to ensure your objects are always oriented exactly as they should be.

## Why FNA Adjuster?

In standard Blender, aligning an object to a specific face and fine-tuning its position often requires a complex sequence of keyboard shortcuts and menu toggling. FNA Adjuster simplifies this into a single, fluid workflow. Extract the rotation from any face, then use our unique Jog-Dial system to "tune" your object into place.

## Key Highlights

### 🚀 Instant Normal Alignment (FNA)
Click any face in Object Mode or select faces in Edit Mode to instantly re-orient your object’s axes to the geometry's normal. No more guessing angles.

### 🖱️ Tactile Jog-Dial Control
Experience a new way to transform. Click and hold the dedicated Jog buttons to rotate or move objects smoothly with your mouse. It feels like handling a physical professional controller.

### ⚙️ Dynamic Sensitivity (On-the-Fly)
Don't stop the action to change settings. While dragging a Jog-Dial, scroll your Mouse Wheel to shift gears from high-speed placement to sub-millimeter precision instantly.

### 🌈 Visual Axis Guidance
Stay oriented with infinite RGB axis lines that appear during operation. These lines respect your Local or World settings, so you always know exactly which way is up.

### 🛡️ Non-Destructive Revert
Experiment without fear. Press `ESC` or `Right-Click` during any drag operation to instantly snap the object back to its original state.

## Perfect for

*   **Hard-Surface Modeling**: Snap bolts, panels, and details to slanted surfaces perfectly.
*   **Environment Art & Set-Dressing**: Place props with an organic, hand-tuned feel.
*   **Precision Engineering**: Achieve exact alignments using a workflow that respects your time.

## Compatibility

*   **Built for the future**: Fully compatible with Blender 4.1, 4.2 (LTS), 4.3, and 5.0 (Experimental).
*   **Optimized** for high-performance GPU viewport drawing.
