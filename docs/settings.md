# Settings & Compatibility

## Settings & Display

*   **Orientation Switch**: Top of panel—**Local** (object axes) or **Global** (world axes). Affects all transforms.
*   **Sensitivity Slider**: Base value for Jog operations (0.01–10.0).
*   **Continue Edit Mode**: Toggle for staying in Edit after key operations.
*   **Transform Display Box**: Bottom of panel shows active object's Location and Euler Rotation for quick viewing/typing without leaving the sidebar.

## Compatibility

*   Fully compatible and tested with **Blender 4.1 through Blender 5.0.1** (latest stable as of December 2025).
*   Supports **Blender 4.5 LTS** (long-term support until 2027) and earlier 4.x versions.
*   Optimized for modern GPU viewport shaders (guide lines use efficient drawing).
*   Mesh objects only; requires standard Blender Python API.
