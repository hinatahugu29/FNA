# Detailed Workflow Examples

## Hard-Surface Bolt Placement on Curved Surface

1.  Select the target face in **Edit Mode** on the base mesh.
2.  Switch to the bolt object -> click "**to Z**" -> instant normal alignment.
3.  Use "**Set Origin to Surface**" (Object Mode click on same face) -> origin at contact point.
4.  **Jog Move Z** to adjust insertion depth.
5.  **Jog Rotate Z** (low sensitivity) to align threads perfectly.

## Environment Prop Dressing

1.  Set panel to **Global** orientation for scene consistency.
2.  Click "**to Z**" and pick ground face -> prop stands upright.
3.  **Jog Rotate/Move** for organic hand-placement feel.
4.  Use **Quick Rotate 90°** for rapid iterations.

## Multi-Object Synchronization

1.  Pose primary object perfectly.
2.  Select duplicates -> use "**Match Axis (Keep Geo)**" to unify orientations without shifting positions.
